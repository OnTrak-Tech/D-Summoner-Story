# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The League of Legends Year in Review AI Agent is a serverless application that analyzes a player's full-year match history using AWS AI services and the League of Legends Developer API. The system generates personalized, engaging end-of-year insights similar to "Spotify Wrapped" but for League of Legends gameplay data. The application provides shareable, visually appealing recaps that help players reflect on their gaming journey throughout the year.
